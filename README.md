### Hi there 👋

<!--
**kwaldenphd/kwaldenphd** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

Life-long baseball fan fascinated by the intersecting stories of players, fans, teams, and communities. Teaching faculty at the University of Notre Dame, working in and around interdisciplinary approaches to data, tech, and computing. 

American Studies/Sport Studies PhD, Library/Information Science MA, Public Digital Humanities Certificate.

In addition to using GitHub for some of my own projects/workflows, it's also home for instructional materials I use in my undergraduate classes.

- 👩‍🏫 I teach classes like "Baseball and America," "[Football in America](https://magazine.nd.edu/stories/cool-classes-football-in-america/)," "[Sport and Big Data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQz86cXgrB3VE9vSTnncjK3b23xPkXlTuyaOMN-P_jo/edit?usp=sharing)," "[Race and Technologies of Surveillance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GB-G1Ssa2eUh6K0cKjAnjmrRhxZ61BgOgLisE-1gVds/edit?usp=sharing)," "[Data Feminism](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P18vOq138X7fWYCttOEvBenxHmja3jL8gf9U6KRxzbk/edit?usp=sharing)," and a two-course "Elements of Computing" sequence ([first course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZG47ylD7Aa4MQW2vaDwq_pT1OeU-bukBh3eYlbAKyA/edit?usp=sharing), [second course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17qiAKuqyFgl2HfVoHJg4HbZEnadGYiYk1cBbvovTjc4/edit?usp=sharing))
- 💻 I work and teach in Python and RStudio, with a focus on data wrangling/processing workflows.
