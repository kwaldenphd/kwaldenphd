Phillis Wheatley,"Wheatley, Phillis",Weatley,Phillis,1773,,"To S.M., a Young African Painter, on Seeing His Works","Wheatley was kidnapped from her home in West Africa, enslaved and brought to North America when she was 7 or 8 years old. A young poet, she wrote this poem to another enslaved child. “S.M.” is the artist Scipio Moorhead, who had probably made a portrait of her. Wheatley praises the artistry of this “wond’rous youth,” writing that seeing his “beauties” “doth give my soul delight.” When Wheatley’s “Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral” was published, it included a frontispiece that is believed to have been based on Moorhead’s portrait of her.",Poetry Foundation,https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52519/to-s-m-a-young-african-painter-on-seeing-his-works
Jupiter Hammon,"Hammon, Jupiter",Hammon,Jupiter,1782,,A Poem For Children With Thoughts on Death,"Hammon was an enslaved poet whose interest in emancipation extended beyond his own life, to the next generation.

Unknown (folk tale),,,,post 1803,,The Story of the Flying Africans,"The story of enslaved Black people rising up and flying home to Africa is a hallmark of African American folklore. While it is difficult to date folk tales founded on oral storytelling, this one has its roots in the 1803 escape of captive Igbo people on St. Simons Island in Glynn County, Ga. Since then, this story has been told and retold in African American literature for both children and adults, including by Julius Lester in his 1969 collection “Black Folktales” and Virginia Hamilton in “The People Could Fly: American Black Folktales,” from 1985",Internet Archive,https://archive.org/details/blackfolktales00lest

Degrass ",Allen,George R.,1829,March 1829,Student Essays Addressing the American Convention for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and Improving the Condition of the African Race,"In March 1829, Freedom’s Journal, the first known African American newspaper, printed several essays by New York African Free School students, commenting on emancipation in New York State (in 1827, enslaved people born before 1799 were freed), arguing for emancipation elsewhere and lauding their own educational opportunities. The students writing here were, so far as we know, between 12 and 15 years old. In his essay Allen wrote: “What sound can be more delightful to the ear of a slave than the expression, ‘The Laws have made you free’? This is the happy case with us in the state of New York. Liberty is an invaluable blessing to us; and we often feel compassion for the thousands of our brethren in the South who are groaning under the chains of bondage, while we are enjoying the benefits of freedom, and one of the most important of these, I conceive to be education.” A letter to the editor confirms that the newspaper provided a gratis subscription to the New York African Free School, where it was available to these and other students who were the children of both free and enslaved Black parents.",Wisconsin Historical Society,https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/pdfs/la/FreedomsJournal/v2n50.pdf
